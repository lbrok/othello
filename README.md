# Othello

### About the game
Othello, also known as Reversi, is a strategy board game where two players take turns placing disks on a 8x8 board. Disks are game pieces with one light side and one dark side. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The player with most disks in one's color wins when there are no possible moves left.
